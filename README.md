Burger App

The essence of this assignment is to create a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM. Node and MySQL are used to query, and  Handlebars are used to generate the HTML.

How The App Should Work
This is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat. Whenever a user submits a burger's name, this app will display the burger on the top section  of the page -- waiting to be devoured. Each burger in the waiting area also has a Devour it! button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the bottom section of the page. This App stores every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
